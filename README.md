# CSC4005-Distributed-System

One of my CS courses at CUHK(SZ).

Hope my homework could give you some hints on the assignments (although I know that this course is quite easy that you may not need extra helpðŸ˜‚).

assignments and my scores:

- odd-even sort (MPI) (100/100)
- Mandelbrot Set Computation (MPI, Pthread) (100/100)
- N-body (MPI, Pthread, OpenMP, CUDA, MPI with OpenMP) (110/110)
- heat distribution (MPI, Pthread, OpenMP, CUDA, MPI with OpenMP) (110/110)

Good luck!
